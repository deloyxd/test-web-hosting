# How to Host Your Simple Static Website

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to host your static website (made of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files) so that anyone with the link can access it online.

We'll cover two main approaches:

1.  **Traditional Hosting:** Using File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or a control panel (like cPanel) provided by a web hosting company.
2.  **Terminal-Based Hosting:** Using modern platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, often leveraging command-line tools and offering generous free tiers for static sites.

The goal is to get your website files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) from your computer onto a web server accessible via a public URL.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Your Website Files:** The `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files located in your project folder (`d:\WORK\Vibe Projects\web - html css js\test-web-hosting`).
- **Text Editor:** An application like VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc., to view or edit code if needed.

**Specific Prerequisites for Each Method:**

- **Traditional (FTP/cPanel):**
  - An account with a web hosting provider (you'll need to sign up for one; many paid options exist).
  - Your hosting account credentials: FTP server address, username, and password, OR login details for a control panel like cPanel.
  - (Optional but recommended for FTP) An FTP client application like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) installed on your computer.
- **GitHub Pages:**
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your computer.
  - A free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- **Netlify CLI:**
  - [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. (npm comes with Node.js).
  - A free account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Method 1: Traditional Hosting (FTP/cPanel)

**Concept:** This method involves renting server space from a hosting company. You then upload your website files directly to that server space using either an FTP client or a web-based file manager in your hosting control panel (like cPanel).

**Step 1: Choose a Hosting Provider**

- There are many web hosting companies (e.g., Bluehost, GoDaddy, SiteGround, Hostinger - _these are just examples, not endorsements_).
- You'll typically need to purchase a shared hosting plan (usually the cheapest option suitable for simple static sites).
- Consider factors like price, customer support, ease of use, and reliability when choosing.

**Step 2: Get Your Hosting Credentials**

- After signing up, your hosting provider will give you the necessary information to access your server space. This will usually be:
  - **FTP Credentials:** Server Address (e.g., `ftp.yourdomain.com`), FTP Username, FTP Password.
  - **OR cPanel Login:** A URL to access cPanel (e.g., `yourdomain.com/cpanel`) along with a username and password.

**Step 3: Upload Your Website Files**

You need to upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to the correct directory on the server, which is often called `public_html`, `www`, `htdocs`, or something similar. Check your hosting provider's documentation if unsure.

- **Option A: Using an FTP Client (e.g., FileZilla)**

  1.  Open FileZilla (or your chosen FTP client).
  2.  Enter the Host (Server Address), Username, and Password provided by your host. The Port is usually 21 for standard FTP, but check if your host specifies otherwise. Click "Quickconnect".
  3.  In the **Local site** panel (usually left side), navigate to your project folder (`d:\WORK\Vibe Projects\web - html css js\test-web-hosting`).
  4.  In the **Remote site** panel (usually right side), navigate into the correct web root directory (e.g., `public_html`).
  5.  Select `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` in the Local site panel.
  6.  Drag and drop the selected files into the Remote site panel (inside `public_html`). Wait for the transfer to complete.

- **Option B: Using cPanel File Manager**
  1.  Log in to your cPanel account using the details provided by your host.
  2.  Look for an icon named "File Manager" and click it.
  3.  Navigate into the web root directory (e.g., `public_html`). Make sure you are inside this folder.
  4.  Click the "Upload" button (usually near the top menu).
  5.  On the upload page, click "Select File" and choose `index.html` from your project folder. Wait for it to upload.
  6.  Repeat step 5 for `style.css` and `script.js`.
  7.  Go back to the File Manager tab; you should see your three files listed inside `public_html`.

**Step 4: Access Your Site**

- Once the files are uploaded to the correct directory, your website should be live!
- The URL will typically be the domain name you registered with your hosting provider (e.g., `http://www.yourdomain.com`) or a temporary URL they provide if you haven't set up a domain yet. Check your hosting account details for the exact URL.

## Method 2: Terminal-Based Hosting (GitHub Pages / Netlify CLI)

**Concept:** These platforms are specifically designed for hosting static websites and often have generous free tiers. They integrate well with developer workflows, using Git and command-line tools for deployment.

### Option A: GitHub Pages

**Concept:** Host your static website directly from a GitHub repository for free.

**Step 1: Prepare Your Project with Git**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd "d:\WORK\Vibe Projects\web - html css js\test-web-hosting"
    ```
3.  Initialize a Git repository if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
4.  Stage your website files for the first commit:
    ```bash
    git add index.html style.css script.js
    ```
    *Note: If you have other files you *don't* want to track (like `hosting_guide.md`), you can create a `.gitignore` file and list them there.*
5.  Commit the files:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial website commit"
    ```

**Step 2: Create a GitHub Repository**

1.  Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.
2.  Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository".
3.  Give your repository a name (e.g., `my-simple-website`).
4.  Choose "Public". **Important:** GitHub Pages for free accounts only works with public repositories.
5.  **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license if you have already run `git init` and committed locally.
6.  Click "Create repository".

**Step 3: Link Local Repository and Push to GitHub**

1.  On the GitHub repository page, copy the commands under "...or push an existing repository from the command line". They will look something like this:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
    ```
2.  Paste these commands into your terminal (still in your project directory) and run them. This uploads your local code to GitHub.

**Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages**

1.  On your GitHub repository page, click the "Settings" tab.
2.  In the left sidebar, click "Pages".
3.  Under "Build and deployment", in the "Source" section, select "Deploy from a branch".
4.  Under "Branch", select `main` as the branch and `/ (root)` as the folder.
5.  Click "Save".

**Step 5: Access Your Site**

- Wait a minute or two for GitHub to build and deploy your site.
- The Pages settings page will update to show the URL where your site is live. It will be something like: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/`
- Visit that URL in your browser!

_(Note: Updates require you to `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` your changes again.)_

### Option B: Netlify CLI

**Concept:** Use Netlify's powerful platform and command-line interface (CLI) for easy static site deployment.

**Step 1: Install Netlify CLI**

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Install the Netlify CLI globally using npm (Node.js Package Manager):
    ```bash
    npm install netlify-cli -g
    ```
    _(If you encounter permission errors, you might need to use `sudo` on macOS/Linux or run the command prompt as Administrator on Windows)._

**Step 2: Login to Netlify**

1.  In your terminal, run:
    ```bash
    netlify login
    ```
2.  This will open a browser window asking you to log in to your Netlify account and authorize the CLI. Follow the instructions.

**Step 3: Deploy Your Site**

1.  Make sure your terminal is still in your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd "d:\WORK\Vibe Projects\web - html css js\test-web-hosting"
    ```
2.  Start the deployment process for production:
    ```bash
    netlify deploy --prod
    ```
3.  The CLI will ask you a few questions:
    - **"Link this directory to an existing site or create a new site?"** Choose "Create & configure a new site".
    - **"Team:"** Choose your Netlify team (usually just your account name).
    - **"Site name (optional):"** You can press Enter to accept a random name or type your own unique name (e.g., `my-cool-simple-site`).
    - **"Publish directory:"** Type `.` (a single period) and press Enter. This tells Netlify your `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are in the current directory.

**Step 4: Access Your Site**

- After the deployment finishes, the terminal will output:
  - **Website Draft URL:** A preview URL (ignore this for `--prod`).
  - **Website URL:** This is your live site URL! It will look something like `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app`.
- Visit the Website URL in your browser.

_(Note: To update your site, simply run `netlify deploy --prod` again from your project directory after making changes.)_
